## IMDB-Clone
This project is an IMDB-Clone built using ReactJS and it is integrated with TMDB API. 

ReactJS is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, while TMDB API is a RESTful web service that provides access to a vast collection of movies and TV show data.

In this project, I have make use of several React hooks such as useState, useEffect, useParams, props, and many routes from react router Dom for handling Routes.

* useState is a hook that allows you to add state to functional components, enabling you to update and manage the state of your application. 
* useEffect is a hook that lets you perform side effects in your component, such as fetching data from the TMDB API and updating the state accordingly. 
* useParams is a hook that extracts parameters from the URL, which is useful for enabling dynamic routing and rendering of specific pages based on user input. 
* Props are used to pass data between components in your application.
* React Router DOM library is used for handling routing and navigation between different components of the application.

Overall, My project provides a user-friendly interface for browsing and searching movies, similar to the popular website IMDB. The integration with the TMDB API provides up-to-date information on movies, including ratings, reviews, and trailers. The use of ReactJS and various hooks allows for a dynamic and responsive user experience.
